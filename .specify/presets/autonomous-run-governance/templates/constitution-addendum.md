## Autonomous Spec Kit Delivery Governance

- Autonomous execution never implies remote write, merge, bypass,
  cancellation, secret, or provider-administration authority.
- Every run declares `LocalImplementation`, `PublishPR`, or `MergeAndSync` from
  the current request. Missing authority defaults to `LocalImplementation`.
- Optional stages repeat to documented convergence criteria, not a fixed count.
- Evidence is created before implementation and records exact acceptance paths,
  permissions, validation, residual risk, follow-up, and resume state.
- Every active run has one feature-local validated state index. A deliberate
  pause requires explicit resume; an unexpected interruption requires drift,
  operation, governance, and authority revalidation before continuation.
- A graceful stop takes priority at the next safe orchestration boundary. It
  preserves work and grants no commit, push, merge, rollback, or process-kill
  authority.
- Shared writers are serialized. Project-specific mutable validation tokens
  authorize one explicit invocation per transition.
- Validation helpers receive an explicit repository root and pass only when
  exit status, required output, and structured/error channels are clean.
- Unavailable reviewers remain missing reviews. Provider bypass requires
  separate explicit authority and repository policy; it is never a preset
  default.
- Every Applicable acceptance gate is declared before implementation and must
  pass machine-checkable exact-head execution mapping before merge. Green names,
  aggregate status, approval, or bypass are not technical evidence.
- A run reaches `Completed` only after its authorized merge or publication
  boundary, default-branch synchronization where applicable, declared
  post-merge actions, and final validation have terminal evidence.
- Persisted remote operations are resumable. Adopt an externally completed
  operation only when its stable identity and exact expected head match;
  otherwise mark it `NeedsRevalidation`.
- Repeated resume requests are lock-protected and idempotent. They must not
  duplicate commits, pull requests, merges, or closeout actions.
- Provider refusal before any technical step is classified separately from a
  technical gate. It is never a passing result and no general billing
  exception is implied.
- Workflow learning separates correctness/evidence fixes from efficiency
  preferences and rejects project-specific behavior from portable governance.
