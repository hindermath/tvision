description: Resume a paused or interrupted autonomous Spec Kit run after a full drift and authority audit.

$ARGUMENTS
```

Resume only an existing run. Do not create a new feature when an active run
cannot be identified. `PausedByUser` requires this explicit command;
`speckit.autonomous` must not resume it implicitly.

Before any mutation:

1. Validate `specs/<feature>/autonomous-run-state.json` and reconcile it with
   current branch, feature metadata, Git history, accepted-artifact hashes,
   `tasks.md`, evidence, and owned/unrelated worktree changes.
   If intake review was active at creation, revalidate the accepted review
   result and normalized target hashes. Stale or missing review evidence is
   material drift and blocks resume until a new result is accepted.
2. Re-read constitution, agent guidance, installed preset versions, and current
   feature prerequisites. Compare mandatory correctness, security, permission,
   and evidence-integrity rules in the current preset stack with the accepted
   Plan, Tasks, and checklists. Re-evaluate delivery authority; a recorded
   delivery mode is historical evidence, not current permission.
   Re-resolve every active `model-routing.json`, the selected local runner
   profile, model, reasoning effort, executable, and preflight. Recompute the
   recorded result hash for the last completed routed phase.
3. Classify drift:
   - no drift: continue from `nextExactAction`;
   - non-material governance or preset drift: run the mandatory-rule delta
     audit, then rerun the affected readiness or Analyze gate before
     implementation;
   - uncertain in-flight operation: rerun only the affected validation or task;
   - invalid routing, profile drift, failed preflight, or a changed handoff
     hash: set `Blocked` and do not start the next phase;
   - material conflict, unknown dirty changes, missing checkpoint, or ambiguous
     feature identity: set `Blocked` and stop.
4. Preserve accepted Specify, Clarify, Plan, Tasks, and checklist phases unless
   their artifacts actually drifted or the delta audit finds a current
   mandatory rule that applies to the accepted scope but has no executable task
   or acceptance check. In that case, amend only the affected Plan, Tasks, or
   checklist entries in place, preserve scope and prior decisions, and rerun
   Analyze. Do not regenerate phases wholesale. New efficiency preferences are
   retrospective input and do not rewrite accepted artifacts automatically.
   Task checkboxes, evidence, and Git history take precedence over a stale state
   index.
5. Record the preset versions compared, applicable mandatory deltas, amendments
   or explicit no-delta result, and rerun gates in the run evidence.
6. Set `status` to `Active`, clear the stop fields, retain
   `authorityRevalidationRequired` until current authority is proven, validate
   the updated state, and continue under `speckit.autonomous` convergence rules.
   Resume a routed phase in a new process; never change models inside a surviving
   process from the interrupted phase.

Finish with reconstructed state, drift disposition, current authority, resumed
action, and any gate that was deliberately rerun. Never start the next feature
implicitly.
