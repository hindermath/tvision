# Script Parity Checklist

## Spec-Kit Run Evidence

- Feature / Spec ID:
- Spec-Kit phase: [specify / plan / tasks / implement / review / release]
- Branch / commit / PR:
- Run date:
- Evidence owner:
- Reviewer:
- Standards / criteria checked: Bash/PowerShell parity, Unix man-page completeness, PowerShell comment-based help, Verb-Noun Cmdlet discipline, dry-run/WhatIf equivalence
- Decision: [Applicable / N/A / Open]
- Evidence path:
- N/A rationale, if not applicable:
- Open follow-up owner and trigger:
- Re-evaluation trigger:
- Certification-readiness note: Use this record to prove that paired scripts, help surfaces, dry-run behavior, exit codes, and platform checks were reviewed in the current Spec-Kit run.

## Audit Evidence Matrix

| Checkpoint / control reference | Applicability | Evidence produced or linked | Result | Residual risk / rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spec-Kit run scope is identified | [Applicable / N/A / Open] | | [OK / Open / N/A] | |
| Standard-specific criteria are mapped | [Applicable / N/A / Open] | | [OK / Open / N/A] | |
| Evidence artefact path is recorded | [Applicable / N/A / Open] | | [OK / Open / N/A] | |
| N/A decisions are justified | [Applicable / N/A / Open] | | [OK / Open / N/A] | |
| Open findings have owner and trigger | [Applicable / N/A / Open] | | [OK / Open / N/A] | |

## Scope

- Script (logical name):
- Change description:
- Reviewer:
- Date:

## Variant Coverage

| Variant | File | Created/updated? | Verified on | Notes |
|---------|------|------------------|-------------|-------|
| Bash | `scripts/<name>.sh` | | macOS / Linux | |
| PowerShell | `scripts/<name>.ps1` | | Windows / pwsh on macOS | |

## Behavioural Equivalence

- Same arguments accepted and same defaults applied:
- Same exit codes and error messages:
- Same dry-run behaviour (`--dry-run` ↔ `-WhatIf`):
- Same check-only behaviour is strictly read-only on every platform:
- Same output format (where applicable):
- Same side-effects (files written, network calls, registry/keychain
  access):

## Documentation

- Unix man-page present at `docs/man/<name>.1`:
- Man-page sections complete (NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS,
  ENVIRONMENT, EXIT STATUS, EXAMPLES, SEE ALSO):
- PowerShell comment-based help present and bilingual (DE first,
  EN second):
- PowerShell help renders correctly via `Get-Help <name>`:
- Help switches `-h` / `--help` and `-Help` documented:

## Cmdlet Discipline

- Cmdlet exposed as Advanced Function with `Verb-Noun` name:
- Verb appears in `Get-Verb` output (approved):
- Cmdlet supports `-WhatIf` and `-Confirm` where state-changing:
- Parameters validated (`[ValidateSet]`, `[ValidateRange]`,
  `[ValidatePattern]`):

## Implementation Discipline

- Bash: `set -euo pipefail` (or documented justification):
- Bash: all variables quoted; no `eval` on untrusted input:
- Bash: Bash 3.x compatibility verified (or 4+ requirement documented):
- PowerShell: `Set-StrictMode -Version Latest`:
- PowerShell: no `Invoke-Expression` on untrusted input:
- PowerShell subprocess calls use `-NoProfile`:
- Windows: `$env:HOME` empty-string handling explicit:
- Repository-root and root-level relative file arguments were tested with and
  without an explicit `./` or `.\` prefix where the CLI accepts both:
- Native-host exceptions are explicitly scoped and do not silently weaken a
  project-wide container or sandbox policy:
- Evidence distinguishes an operating-system result from a provider,
  workflow-name, or runner-label assumption:
