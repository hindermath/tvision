# Intake Authoring Runbook

## Purpose

Use Intake Authoring to create, read, explicitly update, or logically delete
traceable Spec Kit intakes. One approved operation may create or migrate a
series. Use Intake Review afterward for independent semantic acceptance.

## Workflow

1. Name inline, pasted, repository-local, and explicit external sources in
   their intended order.
2. Select a target and profile or accept the policy fallback.
3. Run `$speckit-intake-create` only for new targets.
4. Answer only material questions, one at a time and at most five per pass.
5. Validate the saved intake and receipt.
6. Run `$speckit-intake-create-status` when source or target freshness matters.
7. Use `$speckit-intake-read` for Summary, Detailed, or JSON without writes.
8. Use `$speckit-intake-update` for every normal active-target change.
9. Use `$speckit-intake-delete` for archive plus tombstone; no purge exists.
10. For `ReadyForReview`, manually start Intake Review for the target or
    generated Series request.

## Status Boundary

- `ReadyForReview`: authoring is internally consistent and prompts are enabled.
- `NeedsClarification`: a draft is saved, prompts are blocked, and open decision
  IDs require a human answer.

Only Intake Review can produce `Ready`, `ReadyWithAcceptedRisks`,
`NeedsRemediation`, or `Rejected`.

## Source And Hash Contract

Strict UTF-8 is required. Remove one UTF-8 BOM, normalize CRLF and lone CR to
LF, and change nothing else before SHA-256. Repository-local sources are
freshness-checkable. Inline and safely labelled external sources are snapshots;
their later freshness cannot be inferred.

Public static HTTPS sources are untrusted snapshots. No JavaScript,
authentication, private/local target, cross-origin crawl, unsafe redirect, or
silent truncation is allowed. Same-origin crawls require an exact proposal and
explicit approval.

## Authority Contract

Creation and status never imply implementation. The generated Autonomous
prompt defaults to `LocalImplementation`. A broader mode needs explicit,
current, bounded authority. Bypass, secrets, provider administration, and
follow-on feature execution are never inferred.

## Update And Delete Contract

An existing target is immutable by default. An authorized update records the
old target hash, superseded receipt, current authority, and new source set. Do
not reuse an old receipt after target or source drift.

For a pre-preset target without a receipt, use `LegacyAdoption` instead of
inventing a superseded receipt. Record the prior normalized target hash,
explicit current update authority, and either the exact Git blob or an honest
snapshot-only proof boundary. The prior target hash must also occur in the
ordered source inventory. `LegacyAdoption` preserves the target path and does
not grant implementation or remote-delivery authority.

Create refuses existing targets. Update retains ordinary intake identity and
uses schema 2.0. Series split/merge needs a confirmed migration map. Delete
copies active target and receipt byte-for-byte into the archive before removing
them, then writes a validated tombstone. Referenced series members cannot be
deleted without a series migration or whole-series deletion.

## Transaction Contract

Multi-target Create, Update, and Delete operations are prepared in an operation
directory. Every target, receipt, coverage row, lineage relation, root, and edge
must validate before any active member changes. Failure leaves prior active
state untouched and an explicit incomplete operation boundary.

## Requirements Collection Migration

Use `requirements/intake-governance-config.json` schema 2.0 as the portable
source of documentation language, naming, roles, collection paths, aliases, and
the active Series manifest. Status reports `Aligned`, `MigrationRequired`,
`NeedsClarification`, or `Blocked` without writes.

`DirectoryStrict` requires every matching file in the active directory to occur
exactly once in the Series. `SeriesManifest` preserves an established flat or
mixed layout and treats the validated Series target set as the active inventory.
Both modes compute counts and hashes; neither trusts hand-maintained totals.

An authorized migration records before/after hashes, moves, reference updates,
validation, rollback, and any repair boundary in an operation journal. Publish
the configuration, index, manifest, receipts, prompts, guidance, and links as
one transaction. A partial failure must roll back or end as `NeedsRepair`.
