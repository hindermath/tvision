# Field Validation Summary

Version: `0.3.1`

## Package Validation / Paketvalidierung

- Bootstrap intake review: `Ready`, with no open finding or question.
- Bash and PowerShell fixture suite: passed for ready and blocked receipts,
  strict UTF-8, LF/CRLF/BOM normalization, source and target drift, secret
  rejection, authority limits, supersession, and blocked-prompt enforcement.
- Schema 1.1 legacy adoption: Git-blob and snapshot-only evidence passed in
  both validators; missing update authority and mismatching hashes failed.
- Schema 2.0 lifecycle proof: public-HTTPS evidence, stable intake identity,
  approved two-member series, acyclic graph, transactional publication, and
  archive-and-tombstone deletion passed in Bash and PowerShell. Private URL
  targets, invalid roots, partial publication, and active targets after delete
  failed as required.
- Requirements-collection proof: German, bilingual, and explicit naming
  profiles passed with four portable roles, six collection paths, one
  canonical index, complete active inventory, current normalized hashes, and
  exactly one `Eligible` candidate. Schema 1.0, ambiguous language, path
  traversal, duplicate collections, empty manifests, hash drift, and multiple
  eligible candidates failed with stable error classes.
- Eleven-preset development stack: installation, `list`, `info`, `resolve`,
  disable, enable, remove, and reinstall passed with priorities `10` through
  `80` and Authoring at `64`.
- Agent parity: Claude, OpenCode, Antigravity, Copilot, and Codex each expose
  exactly one Create, Read, Update, Delete, and Create Status entry.
- Mixed-source proof: one inline source, one pasted planning source, and one
  explicitly named repository file produced one `ReadyForReview` intake and
  receipt accepted by both authoring validators.
- Independent handoff: Intake Review accepted the generated target as `Ready`
  with zero findings, questions, or accepted risks.
- Active-series proof: Intake Review Governance v0.1.0 accepted 14 normalized
  v0.1.1 targets, including eleven legacy adoptions, two supersessions, and one
  new intake, with zero findings or accepted risks.
- Downstream isolation: the proof repository has no Git remote and no
  Autonomous or Parallel Autonomous run state; authoring started neither run.

*Der Bootstrap-Review, beide Validatorfamilien, die Git-Blob- und
Snapshot-Altuebernahme, Schema 2.0 mit URL-, Requirements-, Series-,
Transaktions- und Tombstone-Nachweis, der Elf-Preset-Stack, alle fuenf gepflegten
Agentenoberflaechen und die unabhaengige Uebergabe an Intake Review sind
erfolgreich geprueft. Der Test startete keinen nachgelagerten Lauf und besass
kein Git-Remote.*

## Publication And Fleet Evidence / Veroeffentlichungs- und Flottennachweis

The immutable tag, GitHub ZIP SHA-256, repository rulesets, and fleet counts
are recorded in the release notes and in the Home Baseline rollout evidence.
They are produced after this package commit, because an archive checksum cannot
truthfully be known before the release tag exists.

Publication requires no open Critical or High finding. An external Community
Catalog merge is not a local completion condition.
