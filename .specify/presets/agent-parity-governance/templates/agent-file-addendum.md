## Agent Parity Governance Agent Guidance

- Treat shared agent guidance as a single logical document with multiple
  physical surfaces. Use the project's declared parity set as the source
  of truth.
- Common surfaces include `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`,
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`,
  `JUNIE.md`, or project-specific instruction files. Do not assume this
  list is complete.
- Never update one of these files in isolation when the change affects
  shared rules. If you find yourself editing only one, stop and update
  the others in the same change.
- When propagating a shared rule, also update the relevant project
  templates under `.specify/templates/` and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
- Document every intentional deviation: which surface deviates, what it
  deviates from, why, and the expected lifetime of the deviation.
- Document every `N/A` decision with rationale; never silently omit.
- Use `agent-parity-checklist-template` as the standard verification
  artefact for shared-guidance changes.
- For repository-fleet changes, enumerate every level and remote explicitly.
  Do not infer complete coverage from a level-2-only registry.
- A propagated rule is complete only after every target records installation,
  validation, commit, push, and remote synchronization or a named blocker.
- Separate generated files from unrelated working-tree changes with an
  explicit path inventory before staging.
- Treat current normative guidance separately from historical statistics,
  changelogs, archived feature evidence, and compatibility aliases.
- Validate equivalent command meaning across generated skills, prompts,
  commands, and instruction files; matching filenames alone are insufficient.
- When project policy declares learner audiences, language order, readability,
  first-use terminology, prior-knowledge limits, or text-first accessibility,
  propagate that complete policy across every maintained agent surface and
  repository-owned Spec Kit template. Do not reduce it to an agent-specific
  summary.

## Runner and Status Metadata

- Runner profiles may identify an agent family and may record an explicitly
  selected model or reasoning effort.
- Never infer an undeclared model or effort from another agent's local
  configuration. Report `agent default / not declared` instead.
- Do not persist credentials, tokens, secret environment variables, or personal
  identifiers in runner or status metadata.
- Per-worker runner metadata may override a campaign fallback, but permission
  and remote authority remain separate and explicit.

## Spec-Kit Model Routing

- Treat model choice as operational agent-routing guidance, not as a
  feature requirement.
- Do not pin model names in `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, or
  individual feature specs. Those artifacts must remain reproducible even
  when model names change or a different AI agent is used.
- Each agent maps these recommendations to its currently available
  models. Do not derive a fixed vendor or model requirement from this
  preset.
- For Spec-Kit specification, clarification, planning, task generation,
  and analysis, prefer the strongest available frontier reasoning/coding
  model.
- For complete long-running `speckit.implement` or `/speckit-implement`
  runs, prefer the strongest available long-running agent model; use a
  frontier model when maximum judgment quality is more important than
  runtime stability.
- For focused review or CI fixes, prefer a coding-optimized model.
- For trivial cleanup, formatting, or low-risk mechanical edits, a fast
  small coding model is acceptable.
- Use the stable roles `frontier-reasoning`,
  `long-running-implementation`, `coding-review`, `fast-mechanical`, and
  `script-only`. Resolve command roles from installed `model-routing.json`
  files; the strongest applicable wrapper role wins.
- Change models in non-parallel autonomous runs only at a validated phase
  boundary through a new process and SHA-256-bound handoff.
- Local runner profiles must fail closed. Missing profile, model, reasoning
  effort, or successful preflight results in `Blocked`, never a silent
  fallback.

## Audit-Ready Spec-Kit Evidence

- When this preset applies, generated or updated Markdown evidence must include the Spec-Kit run, owner/reviewer, evidence path, applicability decision, N/A rationale where relevant, and open follow-up tracking.
- Do not treat an unfilled starter template as evidence. Evidence exists only after the current run has recorded concrete decisions, paths, and rationale.
