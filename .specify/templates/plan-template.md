## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

[Gates determined based on constitution file]

- **Level-2 environment**: If this plan targets a listed Level-2 project, it
  MUST cite the matching row from the Level-2 Project Environment Registry in
  `constitution.md` and use its runtime, build/test, docs/A11Y, statistics, and
  agent-surface baselines.
- **Memory-safe languages (MSL)**: State the primary implementation language
  and confirm it is on the MSL allow-list in `constitution.md`, Principle XI.
  If the primary language is not an MSL (e.g. C, C++, Assembly, `cc65`), cite
  the justification recorded in the Level-2 `constitution.md`.
- **Secure code generation**: Confirm that AI-generated code will follow the
  language-specific secure-coding rules in `constitution.md`, Principle XII
  (OWASP Top 10 avoidance, parameterised queries, output encoding, quoted
  variables, current cryptographic algorithms, no internal state exposure).
- **Secure software architecture**: Confirm the architecture follows the
  secure-architecture principles in `constitution.md`, Principle XIII (trust
  boundaries, defense in depth, least privilege, fail-safe defaults, attack
  surface reduction, separation of concerns, secure configuration, supply-chain
  security). State how trust boundaries and layered security apply.
- **Security documentation**: Identify which mandatory security documents apply
  (threat model, S-ADRs, arc42 Section 8 security concepts, security checklist,
  dependency audit, security quality scenarios). State whether `docs/security/`
  needs new or updated documents. Templates: `.specify/templates/`.
- **Security standards applicability**: Determine which standards from
  `constitution.md`, Principles XIV-XIX apply. `NIST SSDF` and `CWE Top 25`
  always apply to Level-2; add `OWASP ASVS`, `SBOM`, `VEX`, `SLSA`, `CAPEC`,
  `AI-SBOM`, `NIST Zero Trust`, `BSI C3A`, `BSI C5`, `OWASP SAMM`,
  regulatory applicability (`NIS2`, `CRA`, `EU AI Act`, `DORA`),
  `OWASP Cheat Sheet Series` / `OWASP Proactive Controls`, and
  `OpenSSF Scorecard` where relevant. Mark non-applicable standards as `N/A`
  with justification.
- **AI-SBOM applicability**: State whether AI is used only as a development
  tool, absent from the released/operated system, or present as a runtime or
  product component. If AI runtime or product components are present, plan the
  G7/BSI AI-SBOM evidence across metadata, system-level properties, models,
  datasets, infrastructure, security properties, and key performance
  indicators. If not, record the `N/A` rationale.
- **Release / supply-chain evidence**: State whether the feature requires
  ASVS verification notes, SBOM/VEX artefacts, AI-SBOM evidence,
  provenance/SLSA evidence, CAPEC references, Zero-Trust applicability notes,
  BSI C3A cloud-autonomy applicability, BSI C5 cloud-compliance assurance,
  regulatory applicability, or SAMM follow-up items, and where that evidence
  will live.
- **Default evidence files**: Prefer `docs/security/asvs-verification.md`,
  `docs/security/supply-chain-evidence.md`,
  `docs/security/zero-trust-applicability.md`,
  `docs/security/samm-assessment.md`, and
  `docs/security/cloud-autonomy-applicability.md`,
  `docs/security/cloud-compliance-assurance.md`, and
  `docs/security/regulatory-applicability.md`. If the repository uses an
  equivalent governance location, state that path explicitly and justify the
  deviation.
- **Spec-Kit presets**: List installed governance presets and confirm their
  applicability. Registered Level-0, Level-1, and Level-2 repositories default
  to the exact eight-preset home-baseline matrix unless a justified exception
  is documented.
- **Security-first**: Confirm no credential files, agent state, logs, history,
  or SQLite state are planned for tracking.
- **Inclusion/A11Y**: Identify affected user-facing artefacts and the WCAG 2.2
  Level AA or text-first review path. Confirm that dependencies, states, and
  decisions do not rely on a visual-only representation.
- **Bilingual delivery**: State how DE-first/EN-second requirements apply.
- **Learner baseline**: State how CEFR B2, first-use explanations of technical
  terms, no assumed Spec Kit experience, and first-training-year comprehension
  for IT specialist apprentices and the two IT management occupations apply.
- **Statistics**: State whether `docs/project-statistics.md` needs an update
  and which manual/Thorsten-Solo baseline applies.
- **Agent guidance parity**: State whether `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `GEMINI.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are affected together.
- **Documentation Impact**: Select exactly one of `UpdateRequired`,
  `NoUpdateRequired`, `GeneratedUpdate`, or `FollowUp`. Identify source of
  truth, owner, affected documents, generated derivations, validation, and
  review evidence. Record audience and reader path, navigation impact, document
  class, language partner, platform/example proof, distribution class,
  Home-sync need, and re-evaluation trigger. A `FollowUp` needs owner, risk,
  due date, trigger, evidence, and scope rationale.

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
