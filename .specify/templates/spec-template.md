# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Constitution Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **CR-001**: If this feature targets a listed Level-2 project, the feature MUST
  use the matching Level-2 Project Environment Registry entry from
  `constitution.md` as binding project context.
- **CR-002**: User-facing artefacts MUST identify their A11Y review path
  (WCAG 2.2 Level AA where applicable, text-first fallback otherwise).
  Dependencies, states, and decisions MUST remain understandable without a
  visual-only representation.
- **CR-003**: Learner-facing or shared guidance content MUST be DE-first,
  EN-second unless a synchronized `.EN.md` companion is explicitly chosen.
  It MUST target CEFR B2, explain technical terms at first use, assume no prior
  Spec Kit experience, and be understandable from the first training year for
  IT specialist apprentices and the two IT management occupations.
- **CR-004**: The feature MUST state whether statistics and AI-agent guidance
  files require synchronized updates.
- **CR-005**: The feature MUST name its primary implementation language and
  either confirm it is on the MSL allow-list (`constitution.md`, Principle XI)
  or cite the documented non-MSL justification from the Level-2
  `constitution.md`.
- **CR-006**: The feature MUST determine the applicable security standards from
  `constitution.md`, Principles XIV-XIX, and mark non-applicable standards
  as `N/A` with justification. `NIST SSDF` and `CWE Top 25` are mandatory for
  all Level-2 work.
- **CR-007**: If the feature includes web/API/HTTP/auth-bearing services, it
  MUST declare the selected `OWASP ASVS` level and verification scope.
- **CR-008**: If the feature creates releasable or distributable artefacts, it
  MUST declare the intended `SBOM` / `VEX` evidence path and any required
  provenance / `SLSA` considerations.
- **CR-009**: The feature MUST state whether AI is used only as a development
  tool, absent from the released/operated system, or present as a runtime or
  product component. If AI models, AI services, training/embedding datasets,
  inference infrastructure, or AI runtime components are part of the released
  or operated system, it MUST declare the intended `AI-SBOM` evidence path;
  otherwise it MUST record `AI-SBOM` as `N/A` with a short rationale.
- **CR-010**: If the feature changes trust boundaries, externally reachable
  flows, or distributed/service architecture, it MUST state how `CAPEC` and
  `Zero Trust` applicability will be handled.
- **CR-011**: The feature MUST state whether it uses the default evidence files
  in `docs/security/` (`asvs-verification.md`, `supply-chain-evidence.md`,
  `zero-trust-applicability.md`, `samm-assessment.md`,
  `cloud-autonomy-applicability.md`, `cloud-compliance-assurance.md`,
  `regulatory-applicability.md`) or an explicitly justified equivalent
  governance location.
- **CR-012**: The feature MUST state which installed Spec-Kit governance
  presets apply. Registered Level-0, Level-1, and Level-2 repositories default
  to the exact eight-preset home-baseline matrix unless a justified exception
  is documented.
- **CR-013**: The feature MUST record exactly one Documentation Impact
  decision: `UpdateRequired`, `NoUpdateRequired`, `GeneratedUpdate`, or
  `FollowUp`. It MUST name affected audiences and documentation families.
  It MUST also name affected reader paths, canonical source and owner,
  navigation impact, document class, language strategy and partner,
  platform/example proof, distribution class, Home-sync need, evidence, and
  re-evaluation trigger.
  `FollowUp` also requires owner, risk, due date, re-evaluation trigger,
  evidence, and scope rationale.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]

## Assumptions

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right assumptions based on reasonable defaults
  chosen when the feature description did not specify certain details.
-->

- [Assumption about target users, e.g., "Users have stable internet connectivity"]
- [Assumption about scope boundaries, e.g., "Mobile support is out of scope for v1"]
- [Assumption about data/environment, e.g., "Existing authentication system will be reused"]
- [Dependency on existing system/service, e.g., "Requires access to the existing user profile API"]
