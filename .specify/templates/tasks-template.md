# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.

  The /speckit-tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/

  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment

  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py
- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py
- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py (depends on T012, T013)
- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T016 [US1] Add validation and error handling
- [ ] T017 [US1] Add logging for user story 1 operations

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 2 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T021 [US2] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T022 [US2] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T023 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 3 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [ ] T024 [P] [US3] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T025 [P] [US3] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T027 [US3] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T028 [US3] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] TXXX [P] Verify the implementation against the matching Level-2 Project Environment Registry row in `constitution.md`
- [ ] TXXX [P] Verify the exact eight-preset matrix with `install-spec-kit-governance-presets.* --check-only` / `-CheckOnly`; document any justified repository exception
- [ ] TXXX [P] Verify primary implementation language against the MSL allow-list in `constitution.md`, Principle XI; cite the Level-2 non-MSL justification if applicable
- [ ] TXXX [P] Run the required A11Y/text-first review path for affected user-facing artefacts
- [ ] TXXX [P] Verify learner-facing content is DE-first/EN-second at CEFR B2, explains technical terms at first use, assumes no prior Spec Kit experience, and provides text-first explanations for dependencies, states, and decisions
- [ ] TXXX [P] Update `docs/project-statistics.md` when the feature changes statistics-relevant artefacts or delivery evidence
- [ ] TXXX [P] Review and synchronize affected AI-agent guidance files: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- [ ] TXXX Record exactly one Documentation Impact decision and complete its
  required update, generated render, no-change rationale, or bounded follow-up
  evidence
- [ ] TXXX Verify audience/reader path, canonical source/owner, navigation,
  document class, language partner, platform/example proof, distribution class,
  Home-sync need, and re-evaluation trigger
- [ ] TXXX Validate Documentation Impact evidence with
  `validate-documentation-impact.*` when the repository provides that contract
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in tests/unit/
- [ ] TXXX Security hardening
- [ ] TXXX [P] Verify AI-generated and human-written code against secure-coding rules in `constitution.md`, Principle XII, plus the applicable profile in `.specify/templates/secure-coding-language-rules-template.md`; MSL status alone is not sufficient evidence for secure API, I/O, auth, SQL, crypto, logging, or dependency handling
- [ ] TXXX [P] Verify architecture against secure-architecture principles in `constitution.md`, Principle XIII (trust boundaries, defense in depth, least privilege, fail-safe defaults, attack surface reduction, separation of concerns, secure configuration, supply-chain security)
- [ ] TXXX [P] Update mandatory security documentation in `docs/security/`: threat model, security checklist, dependency audit, arc42 security concepts, and security quality scenarios (SHOULD) - using templates from `.specify/templates/`
- [ ] TXXX [P] Create or update Security Architecture Decision Records (S-ADR) in `docs/security/adr/` for any security-relevant architectural decisions made during this feature
- [ ] TXXX [P] Record the applicable security standards from `constitution.md`, Principles XIV-XIX, and mark non-applicable entries as `N/A` with justification
- [ ] TXXX [P] Apply `NIST SSDF` and `CWE Top 25` to design/review/remediation evidence; add relevant notes to checklist, threat model, ADR, or PR as appropriate
- [ ] TXXX [P] If the feature includes web/API/HTTP/auth-bearing services, document the selected `OWASP ASVS` level and verification scope in `docs/security/` or equivalent project-local documentation
- [ ] TXXX [P] If the feature creates releasable or distributable artefacts, generate/update `SBOM` and, when relevant, `VEX` evidence; capture provenance/SLSA actions for CI/CD or published artefacts
- [ ] TXXX [P] Record `AI-SBOM` applicability: if AI is only a development tool or absent from the released/operated system, document `N/A` with rationale; if AI models, AI services, datasets, inference infrastructure, or AI runtime components are present, update supply-chain evidence with the G7/BSI AI-SBOM clusters
- [ ] TXXX [P] If threat boundaries or externally reachable flows changed, update STRIDE threat modeling and add relevant `CAPEC` references for the highest-risk attack paths
- [ ] TXXX [P] If the system is distributed, service-based, cloud, or remotely managed, document `Zero Trust` applicability; if the project is long-lived, note any `OWASP SAMM` follow-up actions
- [ ] TXXX [P] If the feature selects, operates, or materially depends on cloud services, document `BSI C3A` cloud-autonomy applicability in `docs/security/cloud-autonomy-applicability.md`; if cloud use is only development infrastructure, record `N/A` with rationale
- [ ] TXXX [P] If the feature selects, operates, or materially depends on cloud services, document `BSI C5` cloud-compliance assurance in `docs/security/cloud-compliance-assurance.md`; if cloud use is only development infrastructure, record `N/A` with rationale
- [ ] TXXX [P] If release, market placement, customer handover, cloud operation, AI runtime/product components, financial-sector ICT dependencies, or regulated customers/supply chains are in scope, document regulatory applicability (`NIS2`, `CRA`, `EU AI Act`, `DORA`) in `docs/security/regulatory-applicability.md`; for private training projects, record explicit `N/A` rationale when no regulated scope exists
- [ ] TXXX [P] Prefer the default evidence files `docs/security/asvs-verification.md`, `docs/security/supply-chain-evidence.md`, `docs/security/zero-trust-applicability.md`, `docs/security/samm-assessment.md`, `docs/security/cloud-autonomy-applicability.md`, `docs/security/cloud-compliance-assurance.md`, and `docs/security/regulatory-applicability.md`; document and justify any equivalent governance location
- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation
- [ ] TXXX Lastenheft umbenennen / Rename Lastenheft: `bash scripts/rename-lastenheft.sh <LH-Datei> <branch-name>` (macOS/Linux) . `pwsh scripts/rename-lastenheft.ps1 -File <LH-Datei> -BranchName <branch-name>` (Windows) - stamps the feature branch name onto the filename to mark it as archived

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py"
Task: "Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py"
Task: "Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
