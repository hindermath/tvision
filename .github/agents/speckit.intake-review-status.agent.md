$ARGUMENTS
```

This command is strictly read-only. Locate the selected result and policy,
invoke the installed validator with the repository root, and report:

- mode, review ID, outcome, policy, and review time;
- target paths, normalized hashes, optional Git blobs, and drift;
- findings, questions, accepted-risk ownership, and re-evaluation triggers;
- series and campaign coverage, including unique intake and worker counts;
- for Series mode, request hash, root set, target order, edge count, and DAG validity;
- for schema-2.0 requirements collections, language, profile, portable roles,
  resolved paths, computed inventory, canonical index count, and eligible
  candidate;
- whether Preset 7 or Preset 8 may consume the result under current policy;
- the exact next command.

Do not rewrite timestamps, hashes, status, reports, target files, Git state, or
authority. A successful status check grants no implementation or remote right.
